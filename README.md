- `plots/`: Plots generated by `analysis.Rmd`, including those used in the paper.
- `keyword_analysis/`: Full dataset of 1- and 2-grams in the keywords and abstracts, generated by `analysis.Rmd`.

## Replication
All code for replicating our quantitative analysis, including bar plots and keyword frequency tables, can be found in `analysis.Rmd`. Requires [`pacman`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pacman/index.html).

## Updating the Dataset (for authors)
1. Save most recent raw database of papers as `papers.csv`.
2. Run `make academic-audit-studies.csv` (with R and `Rscript` installed).
